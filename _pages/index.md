Hey, I'm `Sagar Bhat`.

A Python developer with primary expertise in **REST API services** and **Web frameworks** such as `Flask`.
I work with a lot of other cool stuff as well.

Feel free to take a look at [My Projects](#projects) and [My Skills]({{ site.baseurl }}/skills/).


## Professional History

| Role                         | Organization | Location     | Period             |

  1\. At Xoriant, as `API Lead` on the project [Nutanix File Analytics]({{ site.baseurl }}/getting-started/){:target="blank"}, I led the API team of three, and developed **scripts, REST APIs & unit tests** with several core technologies such as `Python, Flask, Docker, ElasticSearch, Kafka, Pytest & Swagger`.

  2\. In `Jan 2020`, due to some health concerns, I was advised to take some time off and I did. I served my notice period and went on vacation. That is when I came across `Freelancing` and the wonderful opportunities it offers.

  3\. As a freelance developer, I've had the opportunity to explore and work on some really interesting projects, involving `Docker, Websockets, Aiohttp, Pyautogui` and more.
